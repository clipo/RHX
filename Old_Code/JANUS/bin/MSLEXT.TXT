!   MultiPROBE II Script Language DLL Extensions (MSLEXT.CSV)
!
!   Use this file to specify C callable functions that you wish to invoke
!   from a MSL script.
!
!   A single record must exist for function.  You may insert comment record(s)
!   anywhere in this file by making the first character in the record an
!   exclamation point (!).
!
!   Several fields (columns) are required for each function.  The columns are
!   comma delimited.  A description of what is expected in each column follows.
!
!   Functions in this file may be directly selectable from WinPREP's user procedure.
!   However, any functions that require argument(s) of types other than "int",
!   "long" or "double" would not be selectable unless column 6 is defined (see below).
!
!   Column      Description
!   ------      --------------------------------------------------------------
!   1           The name of the function as you wish to reference it from the
!               MSL script.
!
!   2           The name of the function as it exists in the DLL.  If you are
!               not sure of the DLL name.  Highlight the DLL file from the
!               Windows NT Explorer and click the right mouse btn.  Select the
!               "Quick View" item.  This will display a window which contains
!               a description of the DLL contents.  Scroll down to the section
!               titled "Export Table" to view the DLL's functions which are
!               callable from the outside.
!
!   3           The DLL file name.
!
!   4           The function's return type:
!
!               Type    Description
!               ----    -----------
!               2       void
!               3       char
!               4       short
!               5       unsigned char
!               6       unsigned short
!               7       unsigned int
!               8       unsigned long   (Note: long and int are the same size in Windows NT)
!               9       int
!               10      pointer to anything
!               14      double
!
!   5           The function's argument list.  This is a series of characters
!               that imply the type, order and number of arguments which the
!               function expects.  The field may be blank for functions that
!               require no arguments.  The signed/unsigned nature of the argument
!               is not considered.
!
!               Character   Description
!               ---------   -----------
!               i           int
!               l           long    (Note: long and int are the same size in Windows NT)
!               d           double
!               c           char
!               p           pointer to anything
!               .           variable argument list
!
!               For example, a DLL function with the following prototype...
!
!                   int MyDllFunct( int nWidgets, double dCost, char *pszName );
!
!               ...would have the following record in this file...
!
!                   MyDllFunct, MyDllFunct, MYDLL.DLL, 9, idp
!
!   6           Optional argument description function.  If a name appears here,
!               the WinPREP application will attempt to invoke it with the following
!               arguments.
!
!                   ArgDescFunct( int nArgs, MSLEXT_ARG_DEF* pArgArray );
!
!               nArgs       The number of arguments that were specified in col 5
!               pArgArray   A pointer to an array of MSLEXT_ARG_DEF structures
!                           (1 for each argument).  MSLEXT_ARG_DEF is defined
!                           in WinPREP.s
!
!               The function should place the argument name, a default value
!               and a description into each element of the argument array.
!               This information will be displayed when the user selects the
!               function (defined in Col 1) from the user procedure's overview
!               page (in the WinPREP application).
!
!               If you do not supply a function for describing the arguments,
!               the function (defined in Col 1) may still be selectable from
!               WinPREP, however, the argument names will be "Arg1", "Arg2",
!               etc.
!
!   7           Optional argument value editor function.  If a name appears here,
!               the WinPREP application will enable a properties button that
!               appears on the user procedure's overview page.  If the user
!               clicks on that function, the editor function will be invoked.
!               Upon return, the argument values displayed in the user procedure
!               overview page will be refreshed.
!               This value editor function would be invoked with the following
!               arguments.
!
!                   ArgEditFunct( int nArgs, MSLEXT_ARG_DEF* pArgArray, HWND hOwner );
!
!               nArgs       The number of arguments that were specified in col 5
!               pArgArray   A pointer to an array of MSLEXT_ARG_DEF structures
!                           (1 for each argument).  MSLEXT_ARG_DEF is defined
!                           in WinPREP.s
!               hOwner      Window handle of the user procedure's overview dialog.
!
!               The intent here is to provide a more application specific
!               method for editing the argument values that will be used
!               at runtime to invoke the function (define in Col 1).
